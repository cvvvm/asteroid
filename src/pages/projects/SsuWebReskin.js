            i led the visual redesign while working with our dev + project management team
            to update every single element, module, or style that appears across the
            hundreds of webpages.

              due to resource limitations, changing functionality wasn't an option.
              collaborating closely was a necessity - balancing how the site needed to
              look while maintaining project scope.

              i built spec sheets for prioritized assets - detailing layouts per
              breakpoint, colors, font styles, and approximate sizing.

              we focused on updating preexisting Drupal modules. the refresh could roll
              out more seamlessly, as most pages wouldn't need many manual changes.
